# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This spec addresses critical content quality issues in the IHK (German Chamber of Commerce) learning application. The fue-04-security module and potentially other modules have severe UTF-8 encoding problems displaying garbled text (e.g., "FÃœ" instead of "FÜ", "MaÃŸnahmen" instead of "Maßnahmen"). 

**Important Context:**
- **FÜ** = "Fachqualifikationen Ü" (Professional Qualifications) - official IHK exam category
- **BP** = "Berufspraktische Qualifikationen" (Professional Practice Qualifications) - official IHK exam category

These category codes are essential and must be preserved - only the encoding needs to be fixed.

Additionally, the project has accumulated numerous unnecessary documentation files that clutter the workspace and should be cleaned up. This cleanup will improve content readability, maintainability, and overall project organization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix UTF-8 Encoding Issues in All Learning Modules

**User Story:** As a student using the learning platform, I want all module content to display correctly with proper German characters (ü, ö, ä, ß), so that I can read and understand the material without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning all module JSON files in `src/data/ihk/modules/` THEN the system SHALL identify all files with UTF-8 encoding issues
2. WHEN a module contains garbled characters like "Ã¼" (should be "ü"), "Ã¶" (should be "ö"), "Ã¤" (should be "ä"), "ÃŸ" (should be "ß"), "Ãœ" (should be "Ü"), "Ã–" (should be "Ö"), "Ã„" (should be "Ä"), "MaÃŸnahmen" (should be "Maßnahmen") THEN the system SHALL correct these to proper UTF-8 characters
3. WHEN fixing encoding issues THEN the system SHALL preserve all JSON structure, code examples, and formatting
4. WHEN all modules are fixed THEN the system SHALL verify that no "Ã" character sequences remain in any module content
5. WHEN modules are corrected THEN the system SHALL ensure all files are saved with UTF-8 encoding

### Requirement 2: Validate and Fix Module Content Formatting

**User Story:** As a student, I want all module content to be properly formatted with correct markdown syntax and structure, so that the content displays correctly in the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning module content THEN the system SHALL identify any malformed markdown syntax (broken headers, lists, code blocks)
2. WHEN a module has formatting issues THEN the system SHALL correct the markdown while preserving the intended structure
3. WHEN modules contain escaped newlines (\\n) THEN the system SHALL verify they are properly formatted for JSON string content
4. WHEN modules are validated THEN the system SHALL ensure all JSON is valid and parseable
5. WHEN content includes special characters THEN the system SHALL ensure proper JSON escaping

### Requirement 3: Remove Undefined Values and Dead Routes

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the application, I want all undefined values and dead routes removed from the codebase, so that the application has no broken links or references.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning the codebase THEN the system SHALL identify all route references that don't match registered routes
2. WHEN a dead route is found THEN the system SHALL either remove the reference or update it to a valid route
3. WHEN scanning module JSON files THEN the system SHALL identify any fields with literal "undefined" string values
4. WHEN undefined values are found THEN the system SHALL either remove the field or provide a proper default value
5. WHEN all fixes are complete THEN the system SHALL verify no broken navigation links exist in the application

### Requirement 4: Clean Up Unnecessary Documentation Files

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the project workspace to contain only necessary documentation files, so that the repository is clean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN identifying files to remove THEN the system SHALL preserve essential files (README.md, LICENSE, deployment docs, error handling guides, accessibility docs)
2. WHEN identifying files to remove THEN the system SHALL remove task summary files (TASK_*_SUMMARY.md) from the root and spec directories
3. WHEN identifying files to remove THEN the system SHALL remove temporary fix documentation (BUILD_FIXED.md, FINAL_FIX_COMPLETE.md, JSON_LOADING_FIXED.md, MODULE_LOADING_FIXED.md, LOADINGSPINNER_FIX.md, etc.)
4. WHEN identifying files to remove THEN the system SHALL remove duplicate or outdated deployment documentation (DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE.md, DEPLOYMENT_SUCCESS_2025.md, DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md, GITHUB_PAGES_DEPLOYED.md, GITHUB_PUBLISHED.md)
5. WHEN identifying files to remove THEN the system SHALL remove analysis and audit reports that are no longer needed (CODE_QUALITY_VERIFICATION.json, COMPLEXITY_ANALYSIS.json, DEPENDENCY_AUDIT.json, PERFORMANCE_METRICS.json, etc.)
6. WHEN identifying files to remove THEN the system SHALL remove code cleanup summaries (CODE_CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md, CODE_QUALITY_FIX_SUMMARY.md, FIXES_APPLIED.md, SEAMLESS_INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md, ZERO_PROBLEMS_ACHIEVED.md)
7. WHEN identifying files to remove THEN the system SHALL remove quiz-related temporary docs (QUIZ_GENERATION_SUMMARY.md, QUIZ_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md, QUIZ_MIGRATION_REPORT.json, QUIZ_STATISTICS_REPORT.json, etc.)
8. WHEN files are removed THEN the system SHALL create a single summary document listing what was removed and why
9. WHEN cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL verify that no broken file references exist in remaining documentation

### Requirement 5: Verify All Module Content Quality

**User Story:** As a quality assurance tester, I want a comprehensive validation of all module content, so that I can confirm all issues have been resolved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation runs THEN the system SHALL check all module JSON files for valid JSON syntax
2. WHEN validation runs THEN the system SHALL verify all required fields are present (id, title, description, content, etc.)
3. WHEN validation runs THEN the system SHALL confirm no encoding issues remain (no "Ã" sequences)
4. WHEN validation runs THEN the system SHALL verify all internal module references (prerequisites, relatedQuizzes) point to existing modules/quizzes
5. WHEN validation runs THEN the system SHALL generate a validation report showing all checks passed
6. WHEN validation finds issues THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with file names and line numbers
