# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on analyzing, refactoring, and cleaning up the codebase to eliminate unused code, reduce duplication, and improve overall code quality. Before removing any code, the system will analyze whether unused components can be integrated or repurposed to avoid creating duplicate functionality. The goal is to create a lean, maintainable codebase that follows best practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Unused Code Analysis

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify all unused code in the application, so that I can understand what can be safely removed or repurposed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the codebase is analyzed THEN the system SHALL identify all unused imports, functions, and components
2. WHEN unused code is found THEN the system SHALL check if it can be integrated into existing functionality
3. WHEN analysis is complete THEN a report SHALL be generated listing unused code with recommendations
4. WHEN code is marked for removal THEN it SHALL be verified that no dynamic imports or runtime references exist

### Requirement 2: Duplicate Code Detection

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to find and eliminate duplicate code, so that the codebase is DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and easier to maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN similar code patterns are found THEN they SHALL be identified and documented
2. WHEN duplicate functionality exists THEN the system SHALL recommend consolidation strategies
3. WHEN code is refactored THEN shared logic SHALL be extracted into reusable utilities or components
4. WHEN duplication is removed THEN all references SHALL be updated to use the consolidated version

### Requirement 3: Component Integration Analysis

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to understand if unused components can be integrated into the application, so that I don't waste existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unused components are found THEN the system SHALL analyze their features and potential use cases
2. WHEN a component has valuable functionality THEN recommendations SHALL be made for integration
3. WHEN integration is not feasible THEN the component SHALL be marked for safe removal
4. WHEN components are integrated THEN they SHALL be properly connected to routing and services

### Requirement 4: Service Layer Consolidation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to consolidate overlapping service functionality, so that business logic is centralized and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple services handle similar operations THEN they SHALL be analyzed for consolidation opportunities
2. WHEN services are merged THEN all dependent components SHALL be updated accordingly
3. WHEN service methods are refactored THEN they SHALL maintain backward compatibility or provide migration paths
4. WHEN consolidated services are tested THEN all functionality SHALL work as expected

### Requirement 5: Dead Route Removal

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove unused routes and navigation paths, so that the routing configuration is clean and accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN routes are analyzed THEN unused or unreachable routes SHALL be identified
2. WHEN navigation links are checked THEN broken or obsolete links SHALL be found and removed
3. WHEN routes are removed THEN the router configuration SHALL be updated
4. WHEN route cleanup is complete THEN all navigation paths SHALL be verified to work correctly

### Requirement 6: Import and Dependency Cleanup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove unused imports and dependencies, so that bundle size is optimized and the codebase is cleaner.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files are scanned THEN unused imports SHALL be identified and removed
2. WHEN package.json is analyzed THEN unused dependencies SHALL be flagged for removal
3. WHEN imports are cleaned up THEN the code SHALL still compile and run without errors
4. WHEN dependencies are removed THEN bundle size reduction SHALL be measured and documented

### Requirement 7: Code Quality Improvements

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to follow consistent patterns and best practices, so that it's easier to understand and maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is refactored THEN it SHALL follow established coding standards and conventions
2. WHEN functions are too long or complex THEN they SHALL be broken down into smaller, focused functions
3. WHEN variable or function names are unclear THEN they SHALL be renamed for better clarity
4. WHEN comments are outdated or misleading THEN they SHALL be updated or removed

### Requirement 8: Fix Wheel of Fortune Empty Module Issue

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Wheel of Fortune to always show valid modules when clicked, so that I can access learning content without encountering empty or broken modules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the wheel is clicked THEN it SHALL never display empty or undefined modules
2. WHEN modules are loaded THEN invalid modules SHALL be filtered out before rendering
3. WHEN no valid modules exist THEN the wheel SHALL display a helpful message
4. WHEN getFallbackModules() is called THEN it SHALL return valid module objects with required properties (id, title, category)

### Requirement 9: Enhance Quiz Results Visual Presentation

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear and visually appealing quiz results after completion, so that I can understand my performance and know what to do next.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a quiz is completed THEN the results SHALL display score as both percentage and fraction
2. WHEN results are shown THEN visual indicators SHALL use color coding (green for correct, red for incorrect)
3. WHEN score is displayed THEN performance badges SHALL be shown based on score ranges (90-100%: Excellent, 80-89%: Very Good, etc.)
4. WHEN results include wrong answers THEN detailed answer review SHALL be available with explanations
5. WHEN results are complete THEN clear next action buttons SHALL be provided (Retake Quiz, Review Incorrect Answers, Continue Learning)

### Requirement 10: Documentation and Summary

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation of all cleanup and refactoring changes, so that I understand what was changed and why.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cleanup is performed THEN a detailed summary document SHALL be created
2. WHEN code is removed THEN the reason for removal SHALL be documented
3. WHEN code is integrated THEN the integration approach SHALL be explained
4. WHEN refactoring is complete THEN before/after metrics SHALL be provided (file count, line count, bundle size)
