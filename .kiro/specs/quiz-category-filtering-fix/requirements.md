# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses issues with quiz category filtering functionality in the IHK learning platform. Users are experiencing problems when trying to filter quizzes by categories - the filtering either doesn't work correctly, shows incorrect results, or fails to update the quiz list properly. The goal is to ensure that category filtering works reliably and provides accurate results when users select different category filters (Daten und Prozessanalyse, Anwendungsentwicklung, Allgemein).

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Reliable Category Filter Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want to filter quizzes by category so that I can focus on quizzes relevant to my specialization area.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a category filter button THEN the quiz list SHALL update to show only quizzes from that category
2. WHEN a user selects "Daten und Prozessanalyse" THEN only quizzes with threeTierCategory "daten-prozessanalyse" SHALL be displayed
3. WHEN a user selects "Anwendungsentwicklung" THEN only quizzes with threeTierCategory "anwendungsentwicklung" SHALL be displayed
4. WHEN a user selects "Allgemein" THEN only quizzes with threeTierCategory "allgemein" SHALL be displayed
5. WHEN a user selects "All Categories" THEN all quizzes SHALL be displayed regardless of category
6. WHEN no quizzes match the selected category THEN an appropriate empty state message SHALL be shown

### Requirement 2: Correct Category Detection and Mapping

**User Story:** As a user, I want quizzes to be correctly categorized so that filtering produces accurate results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a quiz is loaded THEN it SHALL have a valid threeTierCategory field
2. WHEN a quiz has a threeTierCategory field THEN the category indicator SHALL use this field for filtering
3. WHEN a quiz lacks a threeTierCategory field THEN the system SHALL fall back to legacy category mapping
4. WHEN legacy category mapping is used THEN BP-DPA categories SHALL map to "daten-prozessanalyse"
5. WHEN legacy category mapping is used THEN BP-01 through BP-05 categories SHALL map to "anwendungsentwicklung"
6. WHEN a quiz has no recognizable category THEN it SHALL default to "allgemein"

### Requirement 3: Visual Filter State Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see which category filter is currently active so that I understand what content is being displayed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a category filter is selected THEN the corresponding button SHALL have an "active" visual state
2. WHEN a category filter is selected THEN all other category filter buttons SHALL be in inactive state
3. WHEN a category filter is selected THEN the button SHALL have aria-pressed="true"
4. WHEN a category filter is not selected THEN the button SHALL have aria-pressed="false"
5. WHEN the page loads THEN the "All Categories" filter SHALL be active by default

### Requirement 4: Filter State Persistence and Reset

**User Story:** As a user, I want filter combinations to work correctly and be able to reset filters easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN both category and status filters are applied THEN quizzes SHALL match both filter criteria
2. WHEN a user changes category filter THEN the status filter SHALL remain unchanged
3. WHEN a user changes status filter THEN the category filter SHALL remain unchanged
4. WHEN filters result in no matches THEN an appropriate message SHALL explain the current filter state
5. WHEN a user selects "All Categories" THEN the category filter SHALL be reset while preserving status filter

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and Debugging

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging for filter operations so that issues can be diagnosed and fixed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN category filtering fails THEN an error SHALL be logged with details about the failure
2. WHEN a quiz has invalid category data THEN a warning SHALL be logged and the quiz SHALL default to "allgemein"
3. WHEN filter operations encounter errors THEN the user SHALL see a fallback state with all quizzes
4. WHEN debugging is enabled THEN filter operations SHALL log category mapping decisions
5. WHEN category mapping fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to showing all quizzes

### Requirement 6: Performance and Responsiveness

**User Story:** As a user, I want category filtering to be fast and responsive so that I can quickly find relevant quizzes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a category filter is clicked THEN the quiz list SHALL update within 100ms
2. WHEN filtering large numbers of quizzes THEN the operation SHALL not block the UI
3. WHEN category filters are rendered THEN they SHALL appear immediately without delay
4. WHEN quiz cards are re-rendered after filtering THEN the layout SHALL not flicker or jump
5. WHEN multiple rapid filter changes occur THEN only the final filter state SHALL be applied
