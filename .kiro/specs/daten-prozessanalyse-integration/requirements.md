# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhancement adds comprehensive support for "Fachinformatiker für Daten und Prozessanalyse" (Data and Process Analysis) to the existing learning application. Currently, the app focuses exclusively on "Anwendungsentwicklung" (Application Development). This enhancement will expand the content to cover both specializations while introducing a three-tier categorization system that distinguishes between general Fachinformatiker content, Anwendungsentwicklung-specific content, and Daten und Prozessanalyse-specific content.

The enhancement must seamlessly integrate with the existing application architecture without breaking current functionality, ensuring users can access relevant content based on their chosen specialization while maintaining the existing user experience for current users.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a student preparing for Fachinformatiker für Daten und Prozessanalyse, I want access to specialized modules and quizzes relevant to my field, so that I can effectively prepare for my IHK examination.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects "Daten und Prozessanalyse" as their specialization THEN the system SHALL display modules and quizzes specific to data and process analysis
2. WHEN viewing Daten und Prozessanalyse content THEN the system SHALL include topics such as data modeling, process optimization, business intelligence, and data analysis methodologies
3. WHEN a Daten und Prozessanalyse student accesses quizzes THEN the system SHALL provide questions covering database design, data warehousing, ETL processes, and statistical analysis
4. IF a user has not selected a specialization THEN the system SHALL prompt them to choose between Anwendungsentwicklung and Daten und Prozessanalyse

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As any Fachinformatiker student, I want to access general IT content that applies to all specializations, so that I can learn foundational concepts regardless of my chosen field.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL display general Fachinformatiker content that applies to all IT specializations
2. WHEN viewing general content THEN the system SHALL include topics such as IT project management, IT security basics, network fundamentals, and business processes
3. WHEN taking general quizzes THEN the system SHALL provide questions covering cross-cutting IT competencies required for all Fachinformatiker specializations
4. WHEN a user switches between specializations THEN the system SHALL maintain access to general content while updating specialization-specific content

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user of the learning application, I want the content to be clearly categorized by relevance to my specialization, so that I can focus my study time on the most important topics for my examination.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the module list THEN the system SHALL visually distinguish between general, Anwendungsentwicklung-specific, and Daten und Prozessanalyse-specific content
2. WHEN filtering content THEN the system SHALL allow users to show/hide content based on category (general, specialization-specific, or all)
3. WHEN displaying modules THEN the system SHALL use clear visual indicators (colors, icons, or labels) to identify content categories
4. WHEN a user selects a specialization THEN the system SHALL prioritize relevant content while keeping general content accessible

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an existing Anwendungsentwicklung user, I want the application to continue working exactly as before, so that my learning progress and experience are not disrupted by the new features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an existing user opens the application THEN the system SHALL maintain their current progress and preferences
2. WHEN existing users access Anwendungsentwicklung content THEN the system SHALL display the same modules and quizzes as before the enhancement
3. WHEN existing functionality is used THEN the system SHALL perform identically to the pre-enhancement version
4. IF existing users want to explore the new categorization THEN the system SHALL allow them to opt-in without losing current progress

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the new content to integrate seamlessly with the existing data structure and services, so that maintenance and updates remain straightforward.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new Daten und Prozessanalyse content is added THEN the system SHALL use the existing JSON data structure and service architecture
2. WHEN the categorization system is implemented THEN the system SHALL extend existing metadata without breaking current data formats
3. WHEN content is loaded THEN the system SHALL use the existing ModuleService and IHKContentService without requiring major refactoring
4. WHEN new categories are processed THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing module and quiz data

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want to easily add and maintain Daten und Prozessanalyse content, so that the curriculum can be kept current with IHK requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding new Daten und Prozessanalyse modules THEN the system SHALL follow the same content structure as existing Anwendungsentwicklung modules
2. WHEN categorizing content THEN the system SHALL use a clear and consistent metadata schema that identifies content relevance
3. WHEN updating content THEN the system SHALL allow modification of category assignments without affecting module content
4. WHEN managing quizzes THEN the system SHALL support the same quiz format for all specializations while allowing specialization-specific questions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a student switching between specializations, I want to maintain my progress and be able to compare content across fields, so that I can make informed decisions about my career path.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user switches specializations THEN the system SHALL preserve their progress in general and previously completed specialization-specific content
2. WHEN viewing content from different specializations THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which content applies to which field
3. WHEN comparing specializations THEN the system SHALL allow users to view content from both fields simultaneously if desired
4. WHEN progress is tracked THEN the system SHALL maintain separate completion statistics for each specialization while combining general content progress
