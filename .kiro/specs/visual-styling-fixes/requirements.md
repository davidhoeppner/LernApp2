4. WHEN backgrounds and surfaces are rendered THEN they SHALL use consistent elevation and layering

### Requirement 5: Animation and Transition Polish

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth and purposeful animations that enhance the experience, so that interactions feel responsive and delightful.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN page transitions occur THEN they SHALL be smooth and not cause layout shifts
