# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to restructure the existing module and quiz data into three clear, well-organized categories: "Daten und Prozessanalyse" (Data and Process Analysis), "Anwendungsentwicklung" (Application Development), and "Allgemein" (General). The goal is to create a more intuitive and maintainable data structure that better serves both specializations while maintaining backward compatibility and running entirely locally without external database dependencies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Data Categorization System

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the application, I want a clear three-tier categorization system, so that content can be easily organized and filtered by specialization relevance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system loads content THEN it SHALL organize all modules and quizzes into exactly three main categories: "Daten und Prozessanalyse", "Anwendungsentwicklung", and "Allgemein"
2. WHEN content belongs to multiple categories THEN the system SHALL assign it to the most relevant category based on specialization mapping
3. WHEN new content is added THEN it SHALL be automatically categorized based on predefined rules and metadata
4. IF content cannot be automatically categorized THEN it SHALL default to "Allgemein" category
5. WHEN categorizing existing content THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing functionality and user progress

### Requirement 2: Local Data Structure Optimization

**User Story:** As a user of the application, I want fast content loading and filtering, so that I can efficiently access relevant learning materials without external dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL load all content from local JSON files without requiring external database connections
2. WHEN filtering content by category THEN the system SHALL respond within 100ms for typical content volumes
3. WHEN content is restructured THEN it SHALL maintain the existing file-based architecture for offline capability
4. WHEN accessing categorized content THEN the system SHALL use efficient in-memory caching and indexing
5. WHEN the data structure changes THEN it SHALL not break existing import statements or service dependencies

### Requirement 3: Specialization-Aware Content Organization

**User Story:** As a student preparing for either AE or DPA specialization, I want to see content organized by relevance to my chosen path, so that I can focus on the most important topics for my exam.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects "Anwendungsentwicklung" specialization THEN the system SHALL prioritize AE-specific content and show relevant general content
2. WHEN a user selects "Daten und Prozessanalyse" specialization THEN the system SHALL prioritize DPA-specific content and show relevant general content  
3. WHEN displaying content categories THEN the system SHALL show relevance indicators (high/medium/low) for each category based on user's specialization
4. WHEN no specialization is selected THEN the system SHALL show all three categories with equal prominence
5. WHEN switching between specializations THEN the system SHALL preserve user progress and adapt the content view accordingly

### Requirement 4: Backward Compatibility and Migration

**User Story:** As an existing user with learning progress, I want my completed modules and quiz attempts to remain intact after the restructuring, so that I don't lose my learning history.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the new structure is implemented THEN it SHALL maintain all existing module and quiz IDs
2. WHEN user progress is loaded THEN it SHALL correctly map to the new categorized structure
3. WHEN existing services access content THEN they SHALL continue to work without modification to their public APIs
4. WHEN the restructuring occurs THEN it SHALL not require users to reset their progress or preferences
5. WHEN legacy code references old category structures THEN it SHALL be gracefully handled with appropriate fallbacks

### Requirement 5: Enhanced Content Discovery and Navigation

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to easily discover and navigate between related content across categories, so that I can build comprehensive understanding of interconnected topics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing content in one category THEN the system SHALL suggest related content from other relevant categories
2. WHEN browsing "Allgemein" content THEN the system SHALL indicate which specializations find it most relevant
3. WHEN searching for content THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by the three main categories
4. WHEN displaying learning paths THEN the system SHALL show content from multiple categories in logical progression
5. WHEN content has cross-category dependencies THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate prerequisite relationships

### Requirement 6: Maintainable Data Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer adding new content, I want clear guidelines and automated tools for content categorization, so that the data structure remains consistent and well-organized over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding new modules THEN the system SHALL provide clear categorization guidelines based on content metadata
2. WHEN content metadata is updated THEN the categorization SHALL be automatically re-evaluated
3. WHEN inconsistencies are detected THEN the system SHALL provide validation warnings and suggestions
4. WHEN bulk operations are performed THEN the system SHALL maintain referential integrity across categories
5. WHEN the data structure is modified THEN it SHALL include comprehensive validation to prevent corruption
