# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines a comprehensive codebase audit, refactoring initiative, and new "Wheel of Fortune" module selector feature for the IHK Fachinformatiker Lern-App. The project aims to eliminate technical debt (dead code, unused imports, duplicate logic, unreachable code) while maintaining all existing functionality, then implement an engaging random module selection feature that helps users discover learning content in a gamified way.

The work will be executed in strict phases: audit â†’ refactor â†’ validation â†’ feature design â†’ feature implementation â†’ final validation. No feature work will begin until the codebase is stable and refactored.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Comprehensive Codebase Audit

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a complete audit of the codebase to identify all technical debt and code quality issues, so that I can make informed decisions about refactoring priorities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the audit is initiated THEN the system SHALL generate a complete file inventory listing all JavaScript files with their main responsibilities
2. WHEN analyzing functions THEN the system SHALL create a function map documenting name, file, parameters, return types, side effects, and usage
3. WHEN detecting dead code THEN the system SHALL identify and list all functions that are never imported or referenced
4. WHEN analyzing imports THEN the system SHALL detect and list all unused imports per file
5. WHEN checking for duplicates THEN the system SHALL identify near-duplicate logic patterns (e.g., repeated JSON operations, similar component patterns)
6. WHEN analyzing code flow THEN the system SHALL detect unreachable code after returns or exceptions
7. WHEN reviewing error handling THEN the system SHALL flag broad `catch` blocks, silent failures, and missing error logging
8. WHEN assessing performance THEN the system SHALL identify repeated I/O in loops, redundant operations, and missing caching opportunities
9. WHEN reviewing state management THEN the system SHALL flag overuse of state keys without namespacing and missing guard checks
10. WHEN evaluating test coverage THEN the system SHALL qualitatively list untested critical paths
11. WHEN performing security scan THEN the system SHALL check for exposed credentials, hardcoded secrets, and missing environment validations
12. WHEN audit is complete THEN the system SHALL produce an AUDIT REPORT with prioritized findings (High/Medium/Low) and unique IDs (AUD-001, AUD-002, etc.)

### Requirement 2: Structured Refactor Planning

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a risk-ranked refactor plan with clear success metrics, so that I can safely improve code quality without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN planning refactors THEN the system SHALL group findings into categories: DEAD_CODE, CLEANUP, STRUCTURE, RESILIENCE, PERF, MAINTAINABILITY
2. WHEN creating the roadmap THEN the system SHALL provide a table with columns: Batch, Issues (IDs), Rationale, Risk, Est Effort, Success Metric
3. WHEN defining constraints THEN the system SHALL establish SLAs: no functional regression, all tests pass after each batch
4. WHEN identifying boundaries THEN the system SHALL define a "Do Not Touch" list for critical external integrations
5. WHEN establishing safeguards THEN the system SHALL require: commit after each batch, tests between batches, minimal smoke testing
6. WHEN the plan is complete THEN the system SHALL deliver a REFACTOR ROADMAP document with all batches sequenced by risk and dependency

### Requirement 3: Safe Incremental Refactoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to execute refactoring in small, verifiable steps with clear documentation, so that I can maintain code stability throughout the process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN removing imports THEN the system SHALL delete only confirmed unused imports
2. WHEN deleting functions THEN the system SHALL remove only dead functions OR mark with `// RESERVED:` comment if future use is documented
3. WHEN consolidating logic THEN the system SHALL extract near-duplicate code into helper functions WITHOUT changing external semantics
4. WHEN improving type safety THEN the system SHALL add JSDoc type hints to function signatures where trivial
5. WHEN enhancing error handling THEN the system SHALL replace broad `catch` blocks with specific exceptions or re-raise after logging
6. WHEN adding observability THEN the system SHALL introduce minimal logging for critical failure points
7. WHEN documenting changes THEN the system SHALL add `// REFACTOR:` comments summarizing intent for each change block
8. WHEN refactoring is complete THEN the system SHALL produce a CHANGELOG documenting all file/line changes and a DIFF SUMMARY with added/removed function counts

### Requirement 4: Regression Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive validation after refactoring, so that I can confirm all existing features still function correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation begins THEN the system SHALL run existing test suite and record pass/fail results
2. WHEN testing imports THEN the system SHALL verify no import-time crashes occur
3. WHEN testing core features THEN the system SHALL validate: module navigation, quiz functionality, progress tracking, dark mode toggle, search functionality
4. WHEN testing data integrity THEN the system SHALL confirm all IHK modules, quizzes, and learning paths load correctly
5. WHEN testing routing THEN the system SHALL verify all navigation paths work without errors
6. WHEN validation is complete THEN the system SHALL produce a TEST RESULTS document with pass/fail checklist

### Requirement 5: Wheel of Fortune Feature Design

**User Story:** As a learner, I want a "Wheel of Fortune" feature that randomly selects a learning module for me, so that I can discover content in an engaging, gamified way.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the feature THEN the system SHALL display a "Wheel of Fortune" UI component
2. WHEN loading modules THEN the system SHALL source from IHK modules via IHKContentService (fallback to static list if needed)
3. WHEN user clicks "Rad drehen" button THEN the system SHALL trigger a visual selection animation
4. WHEN animation completes THEN the system SHALL highlight and announce the selected module with aria-live region
5. WHEN module is selected THEN the system SHALL provide a "Nochmal" button to spin again
6. WHEN module is selected THEN the system SHALL provide a "Zum Modul" button to navigate to the selected module
7. WHEN providing accessibility THEN the system SHALL include text alternative below wheel with currently selected module
8. WHEN animation completes THEN the system SHALL return focus to spin button
9. WHEN storing state THEN the system SHALL save last selected module in StateManager
10. WHEN integrating into app THEN the system SHALL add new navigation item "ðŸŽ¯ Lern-Modul" without breaking existing navigation
11. WHEN displaying wheel THEN the system SHALL use simplified radial representation OR textual cycling fallback if CSS complexity is too high
12. WHEN animating THEN the system SHALL cycle through modules visually for ~1.5 seconds maximum
13. WHEN handling edge cases THEN the system SHALL provide fallback message if module list has fewer than 2 items

### Requirement 6: Wheel Feature Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear implementation steps for the Wheel feature, so that I can build it systematically with proper testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding navigation THEN the system SHALL create new route `/wheel` with corresponding view component
2. WHEN loading modules THEN the system SHALL implement `loadModules()` function with caching
3. WHEN implementing spin THEN the system SHALL use random selection via `Math.random()` or similar
4. WHEN animating spin THEN the system SHALL loop through module list visually with short delays (max 2 seconds total)
5. WHEN announcing result THEN the system SHALL display success message with selected module name
6. WHEN updating state THEN the system SHALL store selection in StateManager with key `lastWheelModule`
7. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle empty or single-item module lists
8. WHEN providing navigation THEN the system SHALL implement "Zum Modul" button that navigates to `/modules/:id`
9. WHEN implementation is complete THEN the system SHALL produce CODE IMPLEMENTATION summary listing new/edited files
