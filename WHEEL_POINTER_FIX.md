# Wheel Pointer Alignment Fix - 180° Offset

## Issue Discovered

After fixing the fractional rotation bug, the math was working correctly (✓ Match: YES), but there was a visual mismatch:

- The calculation said segment 10 was at the pointer
- But visually, segment 10 was at the BOTTOM of the wheel
- The segment at the TOP (where the arrow points) was the opposite segment

With 30 modules, segment 10 and segment 25 are exactly opposite (180° apart).

## Root Cause

The pointer arrow is positioned at the TOP of the wheel (`top: -10px` in CSS), pointing downward. However, the way segments are drawn and rotated created a 180° offset between:

1. Where we calculate the segment should be (90°, top)
2. Where it actually appears visually (270°, bottom)

This is likely due to the combination of:

- SVG coordinate system starting at -90° (bottom)
- CSS rotation direction
- How the segments are drawn counter-clockwise

## Solution

Added a 180° offset to both the rotation calculation AND the verification formula:

### Rotation Calculation:

```javascript
// Before:
const targetAngle = 90 - targetSegmentCenter;

// After:
const targetAngle = 90 - targetSegmentCenter + 180;
```

### Verification Formula:

```javascript
// Before: Looking for segment at 90° (top)
const segmentAtPointer = Math.round(
  (180 - segmentAngle / 2 - finalRotation) / segmentAngle
);

// After: Looking for segment at 270° (top with 180° offset)
const segmentAtPointer = Math.round(
  (360 - segmentAngle / 2 - finalRotation) / segmentAngle
);
```

## How It Works Now

1. **Select segment**: e.g., index 10
2. **Calculate initial position**: -90 + 10×12 + 6 = 36°
3. **Calculate rotation to pointer**: 90 - 36 + 180 = 234°
4. **Add full rotations**: 3×360 + 234 = 1314° (or 4×360 + 234 = 1674°, etc.)
5. **Final position**: 1314° mod 360 = 234°
6. **Segment 10 is now at**: 36° + 234° = 270° (top of wheel, accounting for offset)

## Testing

After clearing cache and reloading:

1. Spin the wheel
2. Check console: Should still show `✓ Match: YES`
3. **Visually verify**: The segment shown in the result should match the segment at the TOP of the wheel where the arrow points
4. The segment at the bottom should be the opposite segment (index ± 15 for 30 modules)

## Expected Console Output

```
🎯 Spinning wheel:
  Selected index: 10
  Selected module: Kerberos-Authentifizierung und Zugriffskontrolle
🎲 Animation calculation:
  Target angle: 234 (was 54, now +180)
  Total rotation: 1314 (or 1674, 2034)
🏆 Winner verification:
  Final index (selected): 10
  Calculated segment at pointer: 10
  ✓ Match: YES
```

And the segment "Kerberos-Authentifizierung und Zugriffskontrolle" should be visually at the TOP where the arrow points!

## Status

✅ 180° offset added to rotation calculation
✅ Verification formula updated to match
✅ Code formatted and linted
🔄 Ready for testing - clear cache and reload!
