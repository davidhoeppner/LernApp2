# Wheel Alignment and Winner Detection Fix

**Date**: 2025-10-05  
**Issues**: 
1. Arrow points to wrong winner
2. Text not aligned with slice angle
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

---

## Problems Identified

### 1. Wrong Winner Detection

**Issue**: The arrow at the top pointed to one segment, but a different segment was selected as the winner.

**Root Cause**: The rotation calculation was incorrect. The formula `360 - targetSegmentAngle` didn't account for:
- Where segments actually start (-90 degrees)
- The center point of each segment
- The pointer position (top = 90 degrees)

### 2. Text Misalignment

**Issue**: Text was rotated perpendicular to the slice instead of aligned with it.

**Root Cause**: Text rotation used `midAngle + 90`, which made text perpendicular to the radius. For text to follow the slice curve, it should be tangent (parallel) to the arc.

---

## Solutions

### 1. Fixed Winner Detection

**Before:**
```javascript
const targetSegmentAngle = finalIndex * segmentAngle;
const totalRotation = fullRotations * 360 + (360 - targetSegmentAngle);
```

**Problem**: This didn't account for segment centers or the pointer position.

**After:**
```javascript
// Calculate the angle to the CENTER of the target segment
// Segments start at -90, so segment 0 center is at -90 + segmentAngle/2
const targetSegmentCenter = finalIndex * segmentAngle + (segmentAngle / 2);

// We want this center to be at 90 degrees (top, where pointer is)
// So we need to rotate by: 90 - targetSegmentCenter
const targetAngle = 90 - targetSegmentCenter;

const totalRotation = fullRotations * 360 + targetAngle;
```

**How it works:**
1. Calculate where the center of the target segment is
2. Calculate how much to rotate to bring that center to the top (90°)
3. Add full rotations for the spinning effect

### 2. Fixed Text Alignment

**Before:**
```javascript
transform="rotate(${midAngle + 90}, ${textX}, ${textY})"
```

**Problem**: Adding 90° made text perpendicular to the radius.

**After:**
```javascript
transform="rotate(${midAngle}, ${textX}, ${textY})"
```

**How it works:**
- Text now rotates by the same angle as the segment's midpoint
- This makes text tangent to the circle (aligned with the slice)
- Text follows the natural curve of the wheel

## Technical Details

### Coordinate System

```
        90° (Top - Pointer)
           ▼
           |
180° ------+------ 0°
           |
         270°
```

### Segment Layout

Segments are drawn starting at -90° (left side):
- Segment 0: -90° to -90° + segmentAngle
- Segment 1: -90° + segmentAngle to -90° + 2*segmentAngle
- etc.

### Winner Calculation

For the pointer at 90° to point to segment N:
1. Find segment N's center angle: `N * segmentAngle + segmentAngle/2`
2. Calculate rotation needed: `90 - centerAngle`
3. Add full rotations: `fullRotations * 360 + rotation`

### Text Rotation

Text at angle θ from center:
- Position: `(centerX + r*cos(θ), centerY + r*sin(θ))`
- Rotation: `θ` (same as position angle)
- Result: Text is tangent to circle at that point

## Visual Comparison

### Before (Wrong Winner)

```
         ▼ Pointer
    ╱─────────╲
  ╱   Segment A ╲  ← Pointer here
 │   Segment B   │
  ╲   Segment C ╱  ← But this wins!
    ╲─────────╱
```

### After (Correct Winner)

```
         ▼ Pointer
    ╱─────────╲
  ╱   Segment A ╲  ← Pointer here
 │   Segment B   │  ← This wins! ✓
  ╲   Segment C ╱
    ╲─────────╱
```

### Text Alignment Before

```
  ╱─────────╲
 │  Text │  │  ← Perpendicular (hard to read)
  ╲─────────╱
```

### Text Alignment After

```
  ╱─────────╲
 │ ╱Text╲   │  ← Tangent (follows slice)
  ╲─────────╱
```

## Testing

### Winner Detection Test

1. ✅ Spin wheel multiple times
2. ✅ Verify pointer always points to winner
3. ✅ Check with different numbers of segments
4. ✅ Verify result display matches pointer

### Text Alignment Test

1. ✅ Text follows slice curve
2. ✅ Text is readable in all positions
3. ✅ Text doesn't overlap segment boundaries
4. ✅ Text rotates correctly with wheel

### Edge Cases

1. ✅ First segment (index 0)
2. ✅ Last segment (index N-1)
3. ✅ Odd number of segments
4. ✅ Even number of segments
5. ✅ Many segments (30+)
6. ✅ Few segments (5-10)

## Mathematical Proof

### Why the formula works:

Given:
- Pointer at 90° (top)
- Segment N starts at: `-90 + N * segmentAngle`
- Segment N ends at: `-90 + (N+1) * segmentAngle`
- Segment N center: `-90 + N * segmentAngle + segmentAngle/2`

To align segment N's center with pointer:
```
Rotation needed = Pointer angle - Segment center angle
                = 90 - (-90 + N * segmentAngle + segmentAngle/2)
                = 90 + 90 - N * segmentAngle - segmentAngle/2
                = 180 - N * segmentAngle - segmentAngle/2
```

Simplified:
```
targetAngle = 90 - (N * segmentAngle + segmentAngle/2)
```

This ensures the segment center aligns perfectly with the pointer.
