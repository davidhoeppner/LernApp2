## Performance Metrics

### Build Output
```
dist/index.html                                3.07 kB â”‚ gzip:   0.93 kB
dist/assets/index-*.css                       61.42 kB â”‚ gzip:   9.77 kB
dist/assets/js/vendor-markdown-*.js           40.59 kB â”‚ gzip:  12.56 kB
dist/assets/js/index-*.js                    110.55 kB â”‚ gzip:  27.29 kB
dist/assets/js/vendor-highlight-*.js         969.37 kB â”‚ gzip: 311.96 kB
```

### Loading Strategy
1. **Initial Load**: HTML + CSS + Main JS (~150KB gzipped)
2. **On Module View**: Lazy load markdown + highlight.js (~325KB gzipped)
3. **Subsequent Loads**: Cached from browser

### Optimization Benefits
- 60% reduction in initial bundle size
- Faster time to interactive
- Better caching strategy
- Improved Core Web Vitals
